The following transformations were changed to accomodate four channels in the transformer:

Problem: 
Color Jitter can only work on three channels; running it on RGBA removes the fourth dimension.
Solution:
New Color Jitter transformation that randomly chooses three of the four channels and applies the jitter to them as if they were an independent RGB image.

Problem: 
Pillow RGBA resize often zeros out the first three dimensions of the cropped area
Solution:
A bypass that resizes each channel independently, then merges the four channels into a single RGAB image.

Problem:
Pillow solarization is hard coded to only work on greyscale or RGB images.
Solution:
Copied the Pillow solarization code, adapted it to work on all four channels.
